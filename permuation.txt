Permuation
What is permutation?

A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order.
For example, if you have three letters — A, B, and C —
the possible permutations (ways to arrange them) are:
ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA
There are 6 permutations in total.

Is there a way we can simply calculate the permutation without having to manually list all the different arrangements

Let us try to to derive a formula for that.
Let say we have letter A. then there is only one permutation, there is only one way to arrange it. 
We can denote that simply like this: A => A = 1P, this means that A has only one way of arranging it. 1P simply means 1 permeations for simplicity instead of listing all the actual permeations.
Then consequently,
A => A = 1P
AB => AB, BA = 2P
ABC => ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA = 6P
ABCD => ABCD, ABDC, ACBD, ACDB, ADBC, ADCB, BACD, BADC, BCAD, BCDA, BDAC, BDCA, CABD, CADB, CBAD, CBDA, CDAB, CDBA, DABC, DACB, DBAC, DBCA, DCAB, DCBA = 24P
